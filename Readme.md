# 🎬 VideoTube - YouTube Clone (Backend)

A complete **backend learning project** built while following **Hitesh Choudhary Sir’s Chai aur Code YouTube Series**.  
This project focuses on mastering **backend development with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and authentication systems**, by building a fully functional YouTube-like backend called **VideoTube**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

VideoTube is a **YouTube clone backend** built from scratch.  
It covers everything from setting up a Node.js project to advanced backend topics like authentication, database modeling, file uploads, and API design.

This project is perfect for those who want to:
- Strengthen their backend fundamentals.
- Learn production-grade API design.
- Work with real-world use cases (videos, users, subscriptions, likes, etc.).
